## Frequently Asked Questions

**How quickly can I set up a cloud phone system for my business?**

Most modern cloud phone systems activate within minutes to hours, not days. Services like CallHippo and CloudTalk specifically advertise three to five-minute setup times. You typically choose your phone numbers, download apps to your devices, and start making calls immediately. No special equipment arrives by mail, and no technicians visit your office for installation.

**Can I keep my existing business phone number when switching providers?**

Yes, virtually all major providers support number porting, allowing you to transfer existing phone numbers to their systems. The process usually takes a few business days to complete and involves submitting your current account information to the new provider. Microsoft Teams Phone, RingCentral, and other platforms handle this automatically so customers and clients never notice the change.

**What's the difference between a cloud phone system and traditional PBX?**

Traditional PBX requires physical hardware installed at your office location, creating dependency on that specific place and requiring expensive maintenance. Cloud phone systems run entirely over the internet, eliminating hardware costs while enabling your team to work from anywhere with internet access. Cloud systems also update automatically, integrate with modern software tools, and scale simply by adding user licenses rather than installing new equipment.
